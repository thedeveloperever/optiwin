# optiwin
A FOSS fork of HoneCTRL.

## Features
- Affinities
- MSI Interrupts
- Custom Power Plan
- Win32PrioritySeparation
- Debloating *(coming soon)*
- *and more...*

## Changes
- Removing Placebo tweaks
- Adding new tweaks that are proven to help
- On the title screen, I gave people the chance to search what the tweaks do from researchers (which I am not one)

#### Why was this created?
HoneCTRL was discontinued in order to push the closed source project called "Hone". They deemed these tweaks "unsafe for security" whenever their new application has the exact same tweaks and more that could be deemed unsafe, in order to obviously to push their product.
